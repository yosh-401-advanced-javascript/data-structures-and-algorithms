# Reverse an Array


## Challenge
To reverse an array in place, without built in methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
My initital idea was to reverse the array use a count down to reverse the array. I didnt go for it. 
My actual solution was to loop through the array, and divide it by two, making to sure round the
number down to account for the even numbered array.
I set a variable as the index of the array, and passed then essentially passed the indexes back and fourth.


The visual was not complete at the time of this writing.
