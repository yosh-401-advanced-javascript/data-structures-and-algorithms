# Repeated Word


## Challenge
Find the first word that is repeated in a string.

## Approach & Efficiency
I figured this was a hash map assignment... I cant say I really knew what to dol and didnt have time to complete
due to a family thing.
The way I was trying to solve the problem was to match keys. The idea was to
iterate through the string and somehow push each word into an empty object, and from there match the first
keys that matched.
Im pretty sure you cant actually do that. Im not actually sure how to solve the problem...
