# Tic-Tac-Toe
Find the winner in a match of Tic-Tac-Toe

## Challenge
Find out who won a game of tic-tac-toe; X or Y?

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took was initially find the indecies of each element in the array and loop through 
them while they were in helper functions. I didnt really like how it wrote or read.. or frankly came out so the idea
was scrapped. My second method was to simply set x and o as true or false. I then looped through 2 nested arrays, and 
set my win conditions. 

I havnt actually been able to test the code.

## API
