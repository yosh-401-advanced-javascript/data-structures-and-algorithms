# Linked List Insertions
Create and Test Linked List Insertions

## Challenge
The challenge was to build out a linked list and then test for:
1. Can successfully add a node to the end of the linked list
2. Can successfully add multiple nodes to the end of a linked list
3. Can successfully insert a node before a node located i the middle of a linked list
4. Can successfully insert a node before the first node of a linked list
5. Can successfully insert after a node in the middle of the linked list
6. Can successfully insert a node after the last node of the linked list
## Approach & Efficiency
My first approach was to rewatch the demos from class and apply them to what I already knew. I knew nothing.
First i built out the recursive function, hoping that I would be able to eventually get to the other parts of the 
challenge. The function works fine, but whenever i try and test anything with it, I cant get them to pass. 
Ive tried to insert at the head, but I mostly get undefined or null, and cant seem to figure out the logic behind the
issues. 

Looking at my solution I see quite a few errors. They'll need to mended before I give this another go.
