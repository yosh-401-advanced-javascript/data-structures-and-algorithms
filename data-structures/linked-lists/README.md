# Linked List Insertions
Linked List Kth from the end

## Challenge
The challenge was to build out a linked list and then test for:
1. Where k is greater than the length of the linked list
2. Where k and the length of the list are the same
3. Where k is not a positive integer
4. Where the linked list is of a size 1
5. “Happy Path” where k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken here was to traverse the linked list, while counting up in one variable set to 0,
and another set to the parameter k - 1. Essentially working one backwards from the other
