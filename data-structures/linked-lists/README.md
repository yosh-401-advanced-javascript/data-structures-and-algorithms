# Singly Linked List
Create and Test Singly Linked Lists

## Challenge
The challenge was to build out a linked list and then test for:
1. Can it successfully instantiate an empty linked list.
2. Can it properly insert into the linked list.
3. Will the head property point to the first node in the linked list.
4. Can it properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
5. It will return true when find a value within the linked list.
6. It will return false if it cant find a value in the linked list.
7. It will properly return a collection of all values within the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach taken was to analyze the demo code, and find the logic that would move us forward, along with 
looking up and reading more about linked lists and their creation. I believe it is O(1).
