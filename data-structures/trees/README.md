# Find the Leaves of a Tree
Find the individual leaves of a binary tree

## Challenge
Find the leaves of a binary tree with the best efficiency

## Approach & Efficiency
The approach was to recursively traverse a binary tree and once a node was found, that had no left or right branches, 
push that into the stack. Because of this, the root would have been pushed first, and then the leaves. 
Froze up on code writing.
