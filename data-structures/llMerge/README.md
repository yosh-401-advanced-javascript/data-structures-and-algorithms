# Merge two Link'd Lists


## Challenge
to merge two linked lists in place

## Approach & Efficiency
Initially my approach was ... bad.

My second round through the the challenge was to spend a little more time
white boarding and drawing out the algorithm into the smallest possible
units. From there I was easily able to bread down what needed to be done
and actually finally write it. 

O(1)/O(n)
