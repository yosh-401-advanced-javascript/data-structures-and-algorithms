# Two Stacks make a Queue


## Challenge
To make a "queue" out of two stacks.

## Approach & Efficiency
I have the concept down, I just cant figure out where my dequeue is going wrong. I think I could be
writing the tests incorrectly and would like to resolve that.

The method was, I push a value into a new and empty stack, from there I dequeue said stack,
but only if the stack that im trying to push into is empty. If its not, I empty it first and 
return it to the original stack.
