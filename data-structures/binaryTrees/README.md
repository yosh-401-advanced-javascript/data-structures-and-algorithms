#Find the intersection and union between two binary trees

## Challenge
find the union and intersection between two binary trees.

## Approach & Efficiency
My idea here was to traverse each binary tree. Once at the leaf
of the first tree, I would travel back up the tree, inserting the values
into a new map. The next tree would be traversed and its values would
also be added to a new map. I would then compare the two objects and 
discern whether or not there were intersecting values. 

Due to time constraints the code was never finished. I understand
what needs to be done, I THINK.
