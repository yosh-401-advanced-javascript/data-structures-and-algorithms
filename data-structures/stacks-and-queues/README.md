# Stacks and Queues
Stacks and Queues (quesadillas as well) implemented with singly linked lists.

## Challenge
To implement a singly linked list node class.
To implement a LIFO stack with singly linked lists.
To implement a FIFO queue with singly linked lists.
Also. Unit Tests.

## Approach & Efficiency
Im pretty sure this is all O(1), but ive been known to be wrong. The method was choosing because traversing a singly linked
list is inefficient, compared to this method. By adding the back variable to Queue, and the top variable to the stack.
Traversing anything was avoided.

## API
No API's were harmed in the making of this challenge.
